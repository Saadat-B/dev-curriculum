## ‚öõÔ∏è Module 1: React Fundamentals
**Project:** Basic To-Do List
**Objective:** Master the core concepts of React.

### Core Exercises
- [ ] **Setup:** Create a new React project using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
- [ ] **Static UI:** Create an `App` component that renders a title and a hard-coded list of tasks.
- [ ] **Components:** Create a separate `TaskItem` component and render a list by mapping over an array.
- [ ] **State:** Use the [`useState` hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) to manage the array of tasks.
- [ ] **Adding Tasks:** Create a form to add new tasks.
- [ ] **Deleting Tasks:** Pass a function as a prop to delete tasks.
- [ ] **Updating Tasks:** Pass a function to toggle a task's completion status.
- [ ] **Conditional Styling:** Apply different styles to completed tasks.

### Extensions (Optional)
- [ ] **Edit in Place:** Add an "Edit" button that allows the user to modify the text of an existing task.
- [ ] **Filtering:** Add buttons to filter the list by "All," "Active," and "Completed" tasks.
- [ ] **Animations:** Use a library like [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to add simple animations when tasks are added or removed.
- [ ] **Accessibility:** Improve accessibility by adding [ARIA attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) and ensuring the app is fully navigable using only the keyboard.
- [ ] **Error Boundaries:** Wrap your component tree in an [Error Boundary](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary) to catch rendering errors and display a fallback UI.
- [ ] **Portals for Modals:** Create a reusable `Modal` component using [React Portals](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal) to handle confirmation dialogs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Module 2: Advanced Frontend
**Project:** "Pro-Tasker" (Evolving the To-Do List)
**Objective:** Learn to manage complex state, handle forms, and persist data on the client.

### Core Exercises

- [ ] **Professional Forms:** Integrate [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for the "add task" input, including validation.
- [ ] **Modern Styling:** Integrate [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and style the application.

### Extensions (Optional)
- [ ] **Theming:** Use Context to add a dark mode/light mode toggle.
- [ ] **Drag and Drop:** Implement drag-and-drop reordering of tasks using a library like [dnd kit](https://dndkit.com/).
- [ ] **Custom Hooks:** Extract logic into reusable custom hooks.
- [ ] **Testing:** Write unit tests for your reducer functions and custom hooks using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).
- [ ] **Code Splitting:** Use [`React.lazy` and `Suspense`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) to code-split a less critical part of your application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Module 3: Backend with Express & PostgreSQL
**Project:** "Blogify" Backend API

### Core Exercises
- [ ] **Express Server:** Set up an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server with a basic `GET` endpoint.
- [ ] **CRUD Operations:** Create full CRUD endpoints for an in-memory array.
- [ ] **Database Setup:** Integrate [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and define a `Post` model.
- [ ] **Database Connection:** Refactor all endpoints to use the Prisma client.

- [ ] **Protected Routes:** Create middleware to verify JWTs and protect routes.

### Extensions (Optional)
- [ ] **Security Hardening:** Use [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/), [express-rate-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit), and configure [CORS](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html) properly.
- [ ] **Environment Management:** Use [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to manage environment variables.
- [ ] **API Testing:** Write tests for your API endpoints using Jest and [Supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest).
- [ ] **API Documentation:** Generate documentation with [Swagger UI Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express) and create a shareable [Postman Collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/).
- [ ] **File Uploads:** Add functionality for file uploads using [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer).

## üîó Module 4: Full-Stack Integration
**Project:** "Blogify" (Frontend + Backend)
**Objective:** Connect a React frontend to your backend API, handling advanced authentication and authorization.

### Core Exercises
- [ ] **Setup:** Create a new React application for the blog frontend.
- [ ] **Redux Toolkit:** Set up [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) with a `postsSlice` and an `authSlice`.
- [ ] **Fetch Data:** Use [`createAsyncThunk`](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk) to fetch posts from your backend.
- [ ] **Login/Register:** Create forms that dispatch thunks to your auth endpoints.
- [ ] **Authenticated Requests:** Read the token from the Redux store to make authenticated API calls.

- [ ] **Refresh Tokens:** Implement a JWT refresh token flow.
- [ ] **Role-Based Authorization (RBAC):** Add roles to your `User` model (e.g., 'user', 'admin') and protect API endpoints.
- [ ] **Central API Error Handling:** Create a single, centralized error handling middleware in your Express app.
- [ ] **Infinite Scrolling:** Implement an "infinite scroll" feature on the blog feed.
